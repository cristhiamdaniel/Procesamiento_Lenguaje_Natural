A photovoltaic array (PVA) simulation model to be
used in Matlab-Simulink GUI environment is developed and presented in this paper. The model
is developed using basic
circuit equations of the photovoltaic (PV) solar cells including the effects of solar irradiation and temperature changes. The new model was tested using a directly coupled dc load as well as ac load via an inverter. Test and validation studies with proper load matching circuits are simulated and results are presented here.
